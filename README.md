# MineSweeper
It's a minesweeper written in java with javaFX . It's very simple version of minesweeper with only the basic stuff . There's no way to see
how much time a player took to solve one game , so there's nothing like 'best time' . 
P.S : You can't win until you have removed flags from all the non bomb square
