# MineSweeper
It's a minesweeper written in java with javaFX . It's very simple version of minesweeper with only the basic stuff . There's no way to see
how much time a player took to solve one game , so there's nothing like 'best time' . There's no way to stop the player from putting more 
flags than the number of mines present in the board . Flagging has some more issues .
